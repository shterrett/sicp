# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

## What

This is my attempt at _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_.

+ Book: [MIT press](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)
+ Course: [MIT-OCW](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/)
+ Scheme: [MIT-GNU Scheme](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/)

## How

My intention was to work through the entire book, completing all the problems
and watching all the lectures available on the MIT course site above. This was
mostly successful, until the end of Chapter 4. At this point, I began to falter:

+ I'd been working on the course for a long time
+ The problems became somewhat tedious and abstract
+ Help on the internet became sparse
+ The list of other things I want to do was becoming fairly long
+ The material, while interesting and useful, became less directly relevant

So, near the end of Chapter 4, and for basically all of Chapter 5, I began
reading/watching instead of working all the problems. Maybe someday, I will come
back to them.

The problem solutions are fairly complete to the end of chapter 4, and I'm pretty
confident of their correctness through Chapter 3. After that point, executing
the code became somewhat more of a burden, and the answers were harder to check.

Early problems that are not present are scrawled in the margins of my textbook
or worked with pencil and paper and then discarded. In hindsight, I wish I'd
typed in everything, because LaTeX isn't that hard. But alas.
