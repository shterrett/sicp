; English sentences are read and understood from left to right. If
; the parsing program operated in a different order, then the
; hierarchy of information in a sentence would not be preserved.
;
; For instance:
; The boy watched the dog.
; Parsed from left to right, the boy is the subject, and the dog
; is the object. Parsed from right to left, the dog is the subject
; and the boy is the object. The meaning is completely altered.
