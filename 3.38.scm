; Peter + Paul will always be the same, becuase they are using actual numbers.
; the only way the value will be different is Mary acting on different initial
; balances, of which there are four
;
; (Peter -> Paul) -> Mary: 45
; Peter -> Mary -> Paul: 35
; Paul -> Mary -> Peter: 50
; Mary -> (Peter -> Paul): 40

; if Mary withdraws first, and Peter and Paul withdraw concurrently,
; but Peter's withdraw 'wins' setting the balance, the remaining balance
; will be 60.
